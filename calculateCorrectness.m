%This function calculate the testing correctness or training correctness, based
%on what we give as parameter X
%The average testing correctness measures the generalization capability of a
%classifier, i.e. the capability to correctly classify the new data.
%The average training correctness measures the quality of the optimization
%process in the learning phase.

%X = Test or training set
%y = class labels
